## Getting Started

This is to provide the performance testing tool as part of a CI pipeline / local delivery development pipeline
for a service. It's to make sure that CI can operate in a complete containerised world.

Blazemeter test yaml data is mounted into the container under /code where that becomes the WORKDIR and then bzt is run
from that directory on the code

### Environment Variables

* `TAURUS_VERSION` - the version of Taurus BZT to pip install

### Volumes

* `/bzt` - This is where the blazemeter tests are mounted and is also the WORKDIR

### Usage

docker run -v "${PWD}":/bzt quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/taurus:v0.8.3
